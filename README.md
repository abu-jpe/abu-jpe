## 👋 Hi, I'm Promise Abu

💼 I’ve worked in fintech across payments, compliance, and partnerships — helping teams launch products and connect to banking infrastructure.  
💳 I’m especially fascinated by card payments data — how fraud shows up, how authorizations fail, and how you can trace intent in a trail of transactions.  
📁 Right now, I’m building out a portfolio of data projects in SQL and Python — focusing on systems that are often ignored but critical.  
🧰 I like breaking things down, cleaning them up, and learning in public.  
🌍 In the future, I’d like to help take fintech in Nigeria into its next wave — where data connectivity is a reality, not just a buzzword.
✍️ On a more personal note, I love to run and listen to music.
